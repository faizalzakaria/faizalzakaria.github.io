<p>
I'm a Software Engineer/Architect/Entrepreneur and currently
working as a CTO of Duriana (a C2C marketplace in South East Asia), as
well as running my own software consultancy company (<a href="http://codegarage.co" target="_blank">Codegarage.co</a>). I
co founded mingletogether.com (A speed dating online). The project
started in SF back in 2013, but was stopped due to the fact that I
moved to Kuala Lumpur.

<p>
I obtained my Diplôme d'Ingénieur (Master's Degree) majoring in Embedded Systems from École Supérieure d'Ingénieurs en Électronique et Électrotechnique
<a href="http://www.esiee.fr/en" target="_blank">(ESIEE)</a> , Paris. I'm keen on writing clean/maintainable code and won't sacrifice
quickness over correctness.
</p>

<p>
I have worked with a few successful startups, to name a few, Booster.com (owned by CustomInk.com), Duriana (Acquired by Carousell.com), Fave.com (Acquired Groupon SEA), Onploy.com (Backed by Seek Group Australia) and a few others. I have also worked in Paris, France and Silicon Valley, and now I'm travelling around the world working as Nomad Engineer, to help other startups to scale (Onploy, Fave, TidyHQ). On my freetime, I mentor at TheFireHoseProject.com as well as CodeMentor.com.

<p>
I contributed to open source and a happy Unix user since 2001.
