<p>I'm a Software Engineer/Architect/Entrepreneur and currently
working as a CTO of Duriana (a C2C marketplace in South East Asia), as
well as running my own software consultancy company (Codegarage.co). I
co founded mingletogether.com (A speed dating online). The project
started in SF back in 2013, but was stopped due to the fact that I
moved to Kuala Lumpur.
</p>
<p>I obtained my Diplôme d'Ingénieur (Master's Degree) majoring in Embedded Systems from École Supérieure d'Ingénieurs en Électronique et Électrotechnique
(ESIEE) , Paris. I'm keen on writing clean/maintainable code and won't sacrifice
quickness over correctness.
</p>

<p>Previously I worked at Booster (Crowdfunding startup in Boston),
Sigma Designs Inc (SoC company in South Bay/Silicon Valley) and Sigma
Designs Europe (Sigma Design's R&D office in Paris).
</p>

<p>I contributed to open source and a happy Unix user since 2001</p>
