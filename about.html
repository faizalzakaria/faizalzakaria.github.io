<p>I'm a Software/Systems Engineer by title at Sigma Designs, Inc ,
California, USA. I had my Diplôme d'Ingénieur (Master's degree) from
École Supérieure d'Ingénieurs en Électronique et Électrotechnique
(ESIEE) , Paris, majoring in Embedded Systems.</p>
<p>Previously I worked at Sigma Designs Europe, Paris for more than 2 years. I had developed software and systems either from scratch or fork from someone's work. I wrote a software from scratch for Paris Charles De Gaule Airport back then. I enjoy coding and hacking on my freetime. I've been coding in Java, C, C++, python, ruby and bash most of my time. I'm a co-founder / CTO of www.mingletogether.com. Last but not least, I'm a happy Linux user since 2001</p>
