<h4>Quick introduction, what is fluentD ?</h4>

FluentD is an open source data collector for unified logging
layer. Logstash is the other option.

<h4>FluentD + S3</h4>

Recently I was experimenting some architecture conceptual to use
fluentD and S3, that will store all the HTTP requests into S3, and use
that data to build something out of it. Of course I could store /
forward all the requests to a hadoop like service, e.g: `TreasureData`, but this is overprice for a small project that I have. They have a free version for the first few millions rows, but my interest is to scale this out within my budget. If I have 100 requests/minute, then I will have `(100 * 60 * 24)` `144_000 requests / day`. And around `4M requests / month`.

Just for the sake of trying this out, I would like to briefly share
with you what we could do with this data and how to configure a fluentD service.

I'm using
[phoneback-backend](https://github.com/faizalzakaria/phonebook_backend)
as my backend testing app, and
[phonebook-frontend](https://github.com/faizalzakaria/phonebook_frontend)
as my frontend App. I'll be integrating fluentD into the backend app
and store all the API requests into S3.

Roughly this is how the architecture would look like:

Obviously I won't store all the requests into one file. I will split this to a 10 minutes interval. Each 10 minutes it will store all the new requests into a new file.
